# Usage and description
The animations mixin is included by default if you import '~@sebgroup/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap' in your project (import to styles.scss if you're using angular-cli), to optimize your app you should however only import the parts you need.

### Want to import only animations from Bootstrap?
Sure, just add the following (instead of `@sebgroup/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap`)
```scss
@import "~@sebgroup/bootstrap/core";                                               // variables, functions and mixins used by bootstrap
```

## Base state
This is the default state of the component
```html
<a href="https://sebgroup.github.io/bootstrap/animations" target="_blank">Show live example</a>
```
