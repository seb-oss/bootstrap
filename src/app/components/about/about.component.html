    <h3 class="card-title">What is sebgroup/bootstrap?</h3>
    <p class="lead mb-0">sebgroup/bootstrap is a standalone theme built on <a href="https://sebgroup.github.io/bootstrap/" target="_blank">Bootstrap 4</a>, note that there's no dependencies to bootstrap other than the requirement to follow their markup.</p>

    <h4 class="card-title">Bootstrap markup</h4>
    <p>sebgroup/bootstrap has no external dependency to bootstrap but since the project is built on top off bootstrap, all markup examples on their website will work for sebgroup/bootstrap too. Please note that not all components have been styled for SEB yet and this library doesn't include any Javascript either.</p>
    <p>The later is by design as the goal and purpose of this project is to hold <strong>common styles for standard web components</strong> and not control how they work or behave as that would require additional Javascript and that is something most frameworks take care of ie. React, Angular, Vue etc. This is also the reason as to why some of the components like pagination, accordion etc. on the <a href="https://sebgroup.github.io/bootstrap/" target="_blank">demo page</a> doesn't do anything when you try to use them.</p>
